Current tank setup:

10 gal tank (45x30x28cm) -
Some HOB filter with ceramic rings
Generic soil substrate

~8 hours direct light
~8 hours ambient light
~8 hours dark

Plants:
Java moss
Duckweed

Animals:
4 Zebra Nerites
4 Ghost Shrimp

Planned Fish:
6 Neon Tetras
-------------- Getting a bigger tank (30 gal)
6 Kuhli Loaches
4 Otos

Notes:
First tank, I'll probably make a lot of mistakes
Internet says the snails' bio-load may become untenable when I add fish, gonna experiment with Pothos just in case
Lighting may not be optimal, experimenting to see what cycle works alongside ambient light in my room
